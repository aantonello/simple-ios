Simple Framework
================

This is a simple framework with some code to help me doing things the way I need.

Current version is 2.0, upgraded to Xcode 7.3.

Some Observations
-----------------

I use Vim/Gvim for most of my work. The following files are exclusively to use
with my Vim setup. Because it depends on my Vim plugins.

1. .gvimrc: Configuration initialization for GUI Vim. Serves both MAC and
   Windows.
2. simple.vip: My project file. I don't like NERDTree so I use an old plugin
   called "Project" that I tweaked my self. It is available at
   (project_vim)[https://github.com/aantonello/project_vim].
3. onload.vim: A configuration specific to be used with the "Project" plugin.
